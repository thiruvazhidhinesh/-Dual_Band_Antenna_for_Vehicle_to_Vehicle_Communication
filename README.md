In this project, a dual-band shared aperture antenna array is designed that operates 
at both the current Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) band (viz. 5.9 GHz) 
and the future 5G millimeter-wave (mm-wave) band allocated for vehicle-to-vehicle 
(V2V) communications. The design consists of a 2 x 2 differentially fed patch array 
operating at 5.9 GHz, co-printed with a 1 x 2 series fed array operating on a single-layer 
substrate. Two antenna arrays have been designed using two different substrates: Rogers 
RT Duroid 5880 and FR4, and the effect of substrate material type on antenna 
performance has been studied. In particular, the shared aperture array designed using
Rogers operates from 5.854â€“6.001 GHz (DSRC band) with a bandwidth of 147 MHz and 
a gain of 10.63 dB intended for V2V communication. It also operates from 25.626-26.362 
GHz (5G mm-wave band) with a bandwidth of 736 MHz and a gain of 9.778 dB intended 
for 5G mm-wave communication. The ports of the array are highly isolated, with an 
isolation of greater than 50 dB between the DSRC band port and the 5G mm-wave band 
port
